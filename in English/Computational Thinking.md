# Computational Thinking: 
Refers to the process involved in expressing solutions in computational steps or algorithms that can be implemented on a computer. (Aho, 2011; Lee, 2016).

## Problem formulation and solving: 

#### Systematic: 
Computational thinking is a systematic process, involving well-defined steps.
#### Efficient: 
Computational thinking seeks to find efficient solutions that use the minimum amount of resources possible.
#### Human and machine: 
Computational thinking should be understandable by both humans and machines.

* It's a generalist skill.

## Based on 4 pillars:

### Decomposition:
Divide a complex problem into simpler subproblems that are easier to solve. For example, to solve a puzzle, you break it down into smaller pieces.

### Pattern recognition: 
Identify patterns or trends within a particular problem or within different problems. This can occur due to similarities or differences between the problems, or by behavioral patterns (for example, the "sardine effect" or "herd mentality").

### Abstraction:
 "You need to take a particularity of a particular scenario and extrapolate it in such a way that it becomes generalizable." Extrapolate the concept of the problem to a more general form. (What is something abstract? It is something that only exists in the idea or concept. In philosophy, abstraction is any representation that does not correspond to any sensory data or concept. It is that which is difficult to understand. In a figurative sense, abstract means distracted, absorbed.)

### Algorithm design:
 Automate the solution of a problem, defining it step by step. An algorithm consists of an input that needs an output, and a set of operations that will be performed to achieve that solution.
Problem -> Set/Sequence of operations -> Solution

## Continuous process

* Define a solution
* Test the solution
* Improve the solution found. To optimize resources, that is, faster and at a lower cost. (The more efficient, the less resource you should use)

### Cycle:

Analysis (define solution) -> Testing -> Refinement -> Analysisâ€¦

### Variation of the pillars/complementary

* Logical reasoning
* Refinement

## Examples of the use of computational thinking:

#### Chemistry: 
Improvement of chemical reactions through the use of algorithms, through the identification of chemicals.

### Engineering:
Aircraft simulations executed via software instead of a wind tunnel, saving resources.

### Biology:
 Modeling and mapping of the human genome.

### Computer science: 
Simulation of high-order problems on supercomputers.

## Competencies that you gain from computational thinking:

### Systematic thinking: 
Computational thinking is a systematic process, involving well-defined steps. This helps you think more organized and efficiently, both in personal and professional life.

### Teamwork: 
Computational thinking emphasizes the importance of collaboration to solve complex problems. This helps you work better with other people, sharing ideas and resources.

### Creativity and design: 
Computational thinking requires creativity to identify patterns and innovative solutions. This helps you think outside the box and find new ways to solve problems.

### Facilitator:
Computational thinking helps you explain complex concepts in a clear and concise way. This can be a valuable skill in a variety of contexts, from teaching to problem-solving.

### Critical thinking: 
Computational thinking requires the use of logical reasoning to evaluate information and make decisions. This helps you think more critically and make informed decisions.

## Here are some examples of how these skills can be applied in real life:

* A student can use computational thinking to break down a large project into smaller, more manageable tasks.

* An employee can use computational thinking to collaborate with colleagues to find a solution to a business problem.

* A designer can use computational thinking to create a product or service that meets the needs of users.

* A teacher can use computational thinking to explain a complex concept in a clear and concise way.

* A decision-maker can use computational thinking to evaluate information and make informed decisions.
