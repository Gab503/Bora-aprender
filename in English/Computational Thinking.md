# Computational Thinking: 
Refers to the process involved in expressing solutions in computational steps or algorithms that can be implemented on a computer. (Aho, 2011; Lee, 2016).

## Problem formulation and solving: 

#### Systematic: 
Computational thinking is a systematic process, involving well-defined steps.
#### Efficient: 
Computational thinking seeks to find efficient solutions that use the minimum amount of resources possible.
#### Human and machine: 
Computational thinking should be understandable by both humans and machines.

     * It's a generalist skill.

## Based on 4 pillars:

### Decomposition:
Divide a complex problem into simpler subproblems that are easier to solve. For example, to solve a puzzle, you break it down into smaller pieces.

### Pattern recognition: 
Identify patterns or trends within a particular problem or within different problems. This can occur due to similarities or differences between the problems, or by behavioral patterns (for example, the "sardine effect" or "herd mentality").

### Abstraction:
 "You need to take a particularity of a particular scenario and extrapolate it in such a way that it becomes generalizable." Extrapolate the concept of the problem to a more general form. (What is something abstract? It is something that only exists in the idea or concept. In philosophy, abstraction is any representation that does not correspond to any sensory data or concept. It is that which is difficult to understand. In a figurative sense, abstract means distracted, absorbed.)

### Algorithm design:
 Automate the solution of a problem, defining it step by step. An algorithm consists of an input that needs an output, and a set of operations that will be performed to achieve that solution.
Problem -> Set/Sequence of operations -> Solution

## Continuous process

* Define a solution
* Test the solution
* Improve the solution found. To optimize resources, that is, faster and at a lower cost. (The more efficient, the less resource you should use)

### Cycle:

Analysis (define solution) -> Testing -> Refinement -> Analysisâ€¦

### Variation of the pillars/complementary

* Logical reasoning
* Refinement

## Examples of the use of computational thinking:

#### Chemistry: 
Improvement of chemical reactions through the use of algorithms, through the identification of chemicals.

### Engineering:
Aircraft simulations executed via software instead of a wind tunnel, saving resources.

### Biology:
 Modeling and mapping of the human genome.

### Computer science: 
Simulation of high-order problems on supercomputers.
