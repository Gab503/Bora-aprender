# Computational Thinking: 
Refers to the process involved in expressing solutions in computational steps or algorithms that can be implemented on a computer. (Aho, 2011; Lee, 2016).

## Problem formulation and solving: 

#### Systematic: 
Computational thinking is a systematic process, involving well-defined steps.
#### Efficient: 
Computational thinking seeks to find efficient solutions that use the minimum amount of resources possible.
#### Human and machine: 
Computational thinking should be understandable by both humans and machines.

* It's a generalist skill.
